I'm a long time GNU/Linux user. I have a love for programming and learning new technologies. I'm very opinionated and won't hold back if I'm going to say something. I also live in Emacs most of the time and as such I tend to talk about it a lot. Playing around with microcontrollers and embedded systems is another hobby of mine that keeps me occupied.
