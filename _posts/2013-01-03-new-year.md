It's a new year and I'm planing some changes and hope to stick with them. First off I want to spend more time working on personal projects. I'd also like to get off my ass and finally start learning python. It's one of those things that has been on my todo list for quite some time. Other than programming related goals I also have a few personal ones that I'm going to strive for this year. I'm not really going to call these resolutions since I'm not thinking of them in that way but rather things I just want to work toward but under no stress to complete.
