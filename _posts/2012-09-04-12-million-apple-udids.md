So it seems the FBI were holding on to 12 million UDIDs for Apple devices. Thanks to a Java exploit the file was able to be obtained. This also wasn't just a list of UDIDs as it also contained personally identifiable information linking users to the devices. This raises quite a few questions. The first question that crossed my mind is for what purpose did they have all that information. I then wondered how they obtained it. The obvious answer that can be assumed based on the contents of the file is that Apple simply handed it over. Knowing Apple and how much they respect their users it wouldn't surprise me at all if that was the case. The other possibility is there's an unknown iOS explot they're exploiting. Either way this whole incident raises suspicion on both Apple and the FBI. This is just more reason to stay away from Apple devices.
