So it seems the FBI were holding on to 12 millions UDIDs for Apple devices. Thanks to a Java exploit the file was obtained. This also was just a list of UDIDs as it also contain personally identifiable information linking users to the devices. This raises quite a few questions. The first question that crossed my mind is for what purpose did they have all that information. I then wondered how they obtained it. The obvious answer that can be assumed based on the contents of the file is that Apple simply handed it over. Knowing Apple and how much they respect their users it doesn't surprise me at all if that's the case. The other possibility is there's an unknown iOS explot they're exploiting. Either way this whole incident raises suspicion on all parties involved. This is just more reason to stay away from Apple devices.
